# SpeechRecognition

This project investigates the performance of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for speech recognition using datasets with varying train-test split ratios: 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10. The dataset comprises three categories of audio dataâ€”bird, bed, and cat. This study evaluates how different data splits impact the accuracy of HMM models.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains three subfolders:
bird: Contains audio files labeled as "bird."
bed: Contains audio files labeled as "bed."
cat: Contains audio files labeled as "cat."

Each subfolder contains a total number of files, which are split into training and testing datasets according to the specified ratios.

Methodology
Model Selection: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were employed for speech recognition tasks.
Evaluation: The models were evaluated based on accuracy over 10 test runs for each train-test split ratio. The average accuracy for each split was computed to provide a clear comparison.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy (%) was used as the primary metric, measured as the average of 10 evaluations for each split ratio.

To run the project
1. Clone the repository:
   "git clone https://github.com/Darshana275/Split-Ratio-Impact-on-HMMs_SpeechRecognitionModel"
   
   "cd hmm7030 or cd hmm8020 or cd hmm9010"  (based on the train-test split ratio you want to work on)
   
3. Install the dependencies
   Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. These may include libraries such as `numpy`, `scipy`, and `hmmlearn`. Install them using:
  "pip install numpy scipy hmmlearn"

4. Run Prediction:
    Use main.py to predict a word based on the input audio file. Execute the following command:
    "python foldername/main.py"
    where foldername is either hmm7030 or hmm8020 or hmm9010
    Follow the prompts to input the audio file for prediction.

5. Evaluate the Model:
   Use evaluate.py to compute accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and generate ROC AUC curves. Run the script with:
   "python foldername/evaluate.py"
   where foldername is either hmm7030 or hmm8020 or hmm9010
   This script will display evaluation metrics and generate visualizations for model performance.

Results

Split Ratio      Accuracy (%) (Average of 10 Evaluations)
70:30             79.63%
80:20             79.05%
90:10             79.85%

70:30 Split: Achieved the highest average accuracy of 79.63%, indicating a balanced dataset size for training and testing.
80:20 Split: Slightly lower accuracy (79.05%), likely due to reduced testing data.
90:10 Split: Achieved a comparable accuracy of 79.85%, with reduced testing data but increased training data.

Conclusion

The 70:30 split provides a good balance between training and testing data, resulting in the best overall accuracy. However, both 80:20 and 90:10 splits also demonstrate comparable performance, suggesting that HMM models are robust to variations in train-test split ratios within this range.
