# SpeechRecognition

This project investigates the performance of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for speech recognition using datasets with varying train-test split ratios: 70:30, 80:20, and 90:10. The dataset comprises three categories of audio dataâ€”bird, bed, and cat. This study evaluates how different data splits impact the accuracy of HMM models.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains three subfolders:
bird: Contains audio files labeled as "bird."
bed: Contains audio files labeled as "bed."
cat: Contains audio files labeled as "cat."

Each subfolder contains a total number of files, which are split into training and testing datasets according to the specified ratios. Below is the distribution of files used for training and testing:

Methodology
Model Selection: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) were employed for speech recognition tasks.
Evaluation: The models were evaluated based on accuracy over 10 test runs for each train-test split ratio. The average accuracy for each split was computed to provide a clear comparison.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy (%) was used as the primary metric, measured as the average of 10 evaluations for each split ratio.

Results
Split Ratio      Accuracy (%) (Average of 10 Evaluations)

70:30             79.63%
80:20             79.05%
90:10             79.85%

70:30 Split: Achieved the highest average accuracy of 79.63%, indicating a balanced dataset size for training and testing.
80:20 Split: Slightly lower accuracy (79.05%), likely due to reduced testing data.
90:10 Split: Achieved a comparable accuracy of 79.85%, with reduced testing data but increased training data.

Conclusion

The 70:30 split provides a good balance between training and testing data, resulting in the best overall accuracy. However, both 80:20 and 90:10 splits also demonstrate comparable performance, suggesting that HMM models are robust to variations in train-test split ratios within this range.
